## üíª About this project

This repo contains 8 solved challenges from the Clean Code course provided by [@Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br). During the course I could learn more about principles like: domain driven design and solid using NodeJS. Besides that, I could learn more about clean code patterns using ReactJS and TypeScript.

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
